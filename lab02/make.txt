1. "clean" will delets all the compiled programs.
2. ".c.o" is an old-fashioned suffix rule. better way to do this is: %.o : %.c.
This means make any files stem.o from another file stem.c.

"all"->"BINARIES"->"VECTOR_PROG" etc.

I personally think that some rules is still lacking, cause vector_prog is defined but never used.
3. The compiler we use is gcc.
4. we are using std=c99.
5. by using $(FOO) to fetch what it represents.
6. Darwin might suitable for Mac users to compile the program.
7. line starts with $(LFSR_PROG).
